"B<liloconfig> is an interactive program which will ask you a series of "
"questions and write a B<lilo.conf(5)> configuration file for you. It will "
"also set up the Master Boot Record (MBR) so that Linux will boot from hard "
"disk.  It is normally run automatically whenever you upgrade the B<lilo(8)> "
"Debian package."

"The configuration file generated by B<liloconfig> is intended for common "
"installations; if your setup is complicated or unusual you should consider "

"simple MBR, and mark the Linux partition as the active partition.  You will "
"be prompted prior to each of these operations, so you can skip them and "

"actions before writing to the partition table. However, these programs have "
"more checking for 'wrong' values; for instance, they might not allow you to "
"set the active flag on an extended partition (because this is generally a "
"bad idea).  B<activate>, on the other hand, assumes you really do know what "
"you're doing and doesn't have any bothersome prompts or sanity checks.  In "
