"B<liloconfig> is an interactive program which will ask you a series of "

"more checking for 'wrong' values; for instance, they might not allow you to "
"set the active flag on an extended partition (because this is generally a "
"bad idea).  B<activate>, on the other hand, assumes you really do know what "
"you're doing and doesn't have any bothersome prompts or sanity checks.  In "
