.SH NAME
liloconfig \- interactive configure script for lilo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B liloconfig
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B liloconfig
is an interactive program which will ask you a series of questions
and write a
.B lilo.conf(5)
configuration file for you. It will also set up the Master Boot Record
(MBR) so that Linux will boot from hard disk.
It is normally run automatically whenever you upgrade the
.B lilo(8)
Debian package.

The configuration file generated by
.B liloconfig
is intended for common installations; if your setup is complicated
or unusual you should consider writing your own customised
.B lilo.conf.
To do this you should refer to the comprehensive
.B lilo
documentation, which can be found in
/usr/share/doc/lilo/ on Debian systems.

If you have already written your own
.B lilo.conf
then the script will ask you if you wish to keep it, in which case
it will check it for options which are incompatible with the current
version of
.B lilo
and run
.B lilo
to install the boot block.

If you have no
.B lilo.conf
or choose to overwrite it,
.B liloconfig
will perform three operations to ensure that the Linux system will
boot from the hard disk:
install LILO in the Linux partition's boot record, install a
simple MBR, and mark the Linux partition as the active partition.
You will be prompted prior to each of these operations, so you
can skip them and perform them manually later on.

The automatically generated
.B lilo.conf
contains helpful comments, so it might well be a good place to start
even if you wish to roll your own configuration file.
