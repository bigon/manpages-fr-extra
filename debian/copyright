This package was debianized by Denis Barbier and Thomas Huriaux
on 2006/06/07.  This package was previously maintained by
Vincent Renardias (from Oct 1996 to Nov 2002).

Up to manpages-fr 1.69.1, manual pages were downloaded from
http://manpagesfr.free.fr/download/ which is the official
translation in French, provided by Christophe Blaess and
Alain Portal.

But some manual pages are modified in Debian, and it is
difficult to ensure that translations are accurate.  For
these reasons, we decided to fork these translations and
manage them with po4a.  Translations are now maintained
by various contributors of the debian-l10n-french mailing
list, based on previous translations by Christophe Blaess
and Alain Portal.
