"I<most> is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a time, the "
"contents of a file on a terminal.  It pauses after each windowful and prints "
"on the window status line the screen the file name, current line number, and "
"the percentage of the file so far displayed."

#. type: Plain text
#: C/man1/most.1:54
msgid ""
"Unlike other paging programs, I<most> is capable of displaying an arbitrary "
"number of windows as long as each window occupies at least two screen "
"lines.  Each window may contain the same file or a different file.  In "
"addition, each window has its own mode.  For example, one window may display "
"a file with its lines wrapped while another may be truncating the lines.  "
"Windows may be `locked' together in the sense that if one of the locked "
"windows scrolls, all locked windows will scroll.  I<most> is also capable of "
"ignoring lines that are indented beyond a user specified value.  This is "
"useful when viewing computer programs to pick out gross features of the "
"code.  See the `B<:o>' command for a description of this feature."

"In addition to displaying ordinary text files, I<most> can also display "
"binary files as well as files with arbitrary ascii characters.  When a file "
"is read into a buffer, I<most> examines the first 32 bytes of the file to "
"determine if the file is a binary file and then switches to the appropriate "
"mode.  However, this feature may be disabled with the B<-k> option.  See the "
"description of the B<-b>, B<-k>, B<-v>, and B<-t> options for further "
"details."

"Text files may contain combinations of underscore and backspace characters "
"causing a printer to underline or overstrike.  When I<most> recognizes this, "
"it inserts the appropriate escape sequences to achieve the desired effect.  "
"In addition, some files cause the printer to overstrike some characters by "
"embedding carriage return characters in the middle of a line.  When this "
"occurs, I<most> displays the overstruck character with a bold attribute.  "
"This feature facilitates the reading of UNIX man pages or a document "
"produced by I<runoff>.  In particular, viewing this document with I<most> "
"should illustrate this behavior provided that the underline characters have "
"not been stripped.  This may be turned off with the B<-v> option."

"By default, lines with more characters than the terminal width are not "

"RIGHT and LEFT arrow keys may be used to view lines which extend past the "
"margins of the screen.  The B<-w> option may be used to override this "
"feature.  When a window is wrapped, the character `\\e' will appear at the "
"right edge of the window."
