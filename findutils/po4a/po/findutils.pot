"There can be multiple databases.  Users can select which databases B<locate> "
"searches using an environment variable or command line option; see "
"B<locate>(1).  The system administrator can choose the file name of the "
"default database, the frequency with which the databases are updated, and "
"the directories for which they contain entries.  Normally, file name "
"databases are updated by running the B<updatedb> program periodically, "

"B<updatedb> runs a program called B<frcode> to compress the list of file "

"follows."

"The database entries are a sorted list (case-insensitively, for users' "
"convenience).  Since the list is sorted, each entry is likely to share a "
"prefix (initial string) with the previous entry.  Each database entry begins "
"with an offset-differential count byte, which is the additional number of "
"characters of prefix of the preceding entry to use beyond the number that "
"the preceding entry is using of its predecessor.  (The counts can be "
"negative.)  Following the count is a null-terminated ASCII remainder \\(em "
"the part of the name that follows the shared prefix."

# type: Plain text

"If the offset-differential count is larger than can be stored in a byte "
"(+/-127), the byte has the value 0x80 and the count follows in a 2-byte "
"word, with the high byte first (network byte order)."

# type: Plain text

"Every database begins with a dummy entry for a file called `LOCATE02', which "
"B<locate> checks for to ensure that the database file has the correct "
"format; it ignores the entry in doing the search."

"Databases can not be concatenated together, even if the first (dummy) entry "

"There is also an old database format, used by Unix B<locate> and B<find> "
"programs and earlier releases of the GNU ones.  B<updatedb> runs programs "
"called B<bigram> and B<code> to produce old-format databases.  The old "
"format differs from the above description in the following ways.  Instead of "
"each entry starting with an offset-differential count byte and ending with a "
"null, byte values from 0 through 28 indicate offset-differential counts from "
"-14 through 14.  The byte value indicating that a long offset-differential "
"count follows is 0x1e (30), not 0x80.  The long counts are stored in host "
"byte order, which is not necessarily network byte order, and host integer "
"word size, which is usually 4 bytes.  They also represent a count 14 less "
"than their value.  The database lines have no termination byte; the start of "
"the next line is indicated by its first byte having a value E<lt>= 30."
msgstr ""

# type: Plain text
#: english/man5/locatedb.5:76
msgid ""
"In addition, instead of starting with a dummy entry, the old database format "
"starts with a 256 byte table containing the 128 most common bigrams in the "
"file list.  A bigram is a pair of adjacent bytes.  Bytes in the database "
"that have the high bit set are indexes (with the high bit cleared) into the "
"bigram table.  The bigram and offset-differential count coding makes these "
"databases 20-25% smaller than the new format, but makes them not 8-bit "
"clean.  Any byte in a file name that is in the ranges used for the special "
"codes is replaced in the database by a question mark, which not "
"coincidentally is the shell wildcard to match a single character."
