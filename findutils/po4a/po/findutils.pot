"There is also an old database format, used by Unix B<locate> and B<find> "
"programs and earlier releases of the GNU ones.  B<updatedb> runs programs "
"called B<bigram> and B<code> to produce old-format databases.  The old "
"format differs from the above description in the following ways.  Instead of "
"each entry starting with an offset-differential count byte and ending with a "
"null, byte values from 0 through 28 indicate offset-differential counts from "
"-14 through 14.  The byte value indicating that a long offset-differential "
"count follows is 0x1e (30), not 0x80.  The long counts are stored in host "
"byte order, which is not necessarily network byte order, and host integer "
"word size, which is usually 4 bytes.  They also represent a count 14 less "
"than their value.  The database lines have no termination byte; the start of "
"the next line is indicated by its first byte having a value E<lt>= 30."

"In addition, instead of starting with a dummy entry, the old database format "
"starts with a 256 byte table containing the 128 most common bigrams in the "
"file list.  A bigram is a pair of adjacent bytes.  Bytes in the database "
"that have the high bit set are indexes (with the high bit cleared) into the "
"bigram table.  The bigram and offset-differential count coding makes these "
"databases 20-25% smaller than the new format, but makes them not 8-bit "
"clean.  Any byte in a file name that is in the ranges used for the special "
"codes is replaced in the database by a question mark, which not "
"coincidentally is the shell wildcard to match a single character."
