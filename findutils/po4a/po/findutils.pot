"This manual page documents the GNU version of B<locate>.  For each given "
"pattern, B<locate> searches one or more databases of file names and displays "
"the file names that contain the pattern.  Patterns can contain shell-style "
"metacharacters: `*', `?', and `[]'.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or "
"`.' specially.  Therefore, a pattern `foo*bar' can match a file name that "
"contains `foo3/bar', and a pattern `*duck*' can match a file name that "
"contains `lake/.ducky'.  Patterns that contain metacharacters should be "
"quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell."

"If a pattern is a plain string \\(em it contains no metacharacters \\(em "
"B<locate> displays all file names in the database that contain that string "
"anywhere.  If a pattern does contain metacharacters, B<locate> only displays "
"file names that match the pattern exactly.  As a result, patterns that "
"contain metacharacters should usually begin with a `*', and will most often "
"end with one as well.  The exceptions are patterns that are intended to "
"explicitly match the beginning or end of a file name."
