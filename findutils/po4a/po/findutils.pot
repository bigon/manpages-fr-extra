"The link count of directories which contain entries which are hard links to "

"mean that GNU find will sometimes optimise away the visiting of a "
"subdirectory which is actually a link to an ancestor.  Since B<find> does "
"not actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid emitting a "
"diagnostic message.  Although this behaviour may be somewhat confusing, it "
"is unlikely that anybody actually depends on this behaviour.  If the leaf "
"optimisation has been turned off with B<-noleaf>, the directory entry will "
"always be examined and the diagnostic message will be issued where it is "
"appropriate.  Symbolic links cannot be used to create filesystem cycles as "
"such, but if the -L option or the -follow option is in use, a diagnostic "
"message is issued when B<find> encounters a loop of symbolic links.  As with "
"loops containing hard links, the leaf optimisation will often mean that "
"B<find> knows that it doesn't need to call I<stat()> or I<chdir()> on the "
"symbolic link, so this diagnostic is frequently not necessary."
