"There is also an old database format, used by Unix B<locate> and B<find> "

"each entry starting with an offset-differential count byte and ending with a "
"null, byte values from 0 through 28 indicate offset-differential counts from "
"-14 through 14.  The byte value indicating that a long offset-differential "

"byte order, which is not necessarily network byte order, and host integer "
"word size, which is usually 4 bytes.  They also represent a count 14 less "
"than their value.  The database lines have no termination byte; the start of "
