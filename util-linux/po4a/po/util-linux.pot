"The B<readprofile> command uses the B</proc/profile> information to print "

"the first is the number of clock ticks, the second is the name of the C "
"function in the kernel where those many ticks occurred, and the third is the "
"normalized `load' of the procedure, calculated as a ratio between the number "
