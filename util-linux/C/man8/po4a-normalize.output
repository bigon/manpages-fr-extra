.TH CTRLALTDEL 8 "25 October 1993" "Linux 1.2" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
ctrlaltdel \- set the function of the Ctrl\-Alt\-Del combination
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBctrlaltdel hard\fP | \fBsoft\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Based on examination of the \fIlinux/kernel/sys.c\fP code, it is clear that
there are two supported functions that the Ctrl\-Alt\-Del sequence can
perform: a \fIhard\fP reset, which immediately reboots the computer without
calling \fBsync (2)\fP and without any other preparation; and a \fIsoft\fP reset,
which sends the SIGINT (interrupt) signal to the \fBinit\fP process (this is
always the process with PID 1).  If this option is used, the \fBinit (8)\fP
program must support this feature.  Since there are now several \fBinit (8)\fP
programs in the Linux community, please consult the documentation for the
version that you are currently using.

\fBctrlaltdel\fP is usually used in the \fI/etc/rc.local\fP file.
