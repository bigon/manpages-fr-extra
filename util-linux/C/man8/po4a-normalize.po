"Based on examination of the I<linux/kernel/sys.c> code, it is clear that "
"there are two supported functions that the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence can "
"perform: a I<hard> reset, which immediately reboots the computer without "
"calling B<sync (2)> and without any other preparation; and a I<soft> reset, "
"which sends the SIGINT (interrupt) signal to the B<init> process (this is "
"always the process with PID 1).  If this option is used, the B<init (8)> "
"program must support this feature.  Since there are now several B<init (8)> "
"programs in the Linux community, please consult the documentation for the "
"version that you are currently using."
