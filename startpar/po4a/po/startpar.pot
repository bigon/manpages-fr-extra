"startpar is used to run multiple run-level scripts in parallel.  The degree "

"is full parallelism. An argument to all of the scripts can be provided with "
"the B<-a> option.  Processes blocked by pending B<I/O> will cause new "
"process creation to be weighted by the iorate factor I<800>.  To change this "
"factor the option B<-i> can be used to specify another value.  The amount"
